# Section 24: Express.js with Node.js:


## 200. What is Express?


The Express framework is built ontop of Node and is going to help create our backends.
    Looking at all frameworks in existence, Express ranks #4.
Now while the backend framework that JavaScript uses is considered to be Node, it's not actually a framework.
    Instead, Node is a runtime environment.
    And runtime environments simply enable us to use JavaScript on the computer and not exclusively within the browser.
But Express, is a JavaScript framework that allows us to create backends for our websites.
    Node and Express combined is how most professional developers create their backends.
We need Express because Node is too powerful and all encompassing.
    You can use Node to do a lot of things because all it does is allow us to run JavaScript on any computer, meaning it can be used to do many things.
    You can use Node for your backend, but you can also use it for coding IoT devices and desktop apps (such as VS Code).
When we have a tool or language that allows us to do many things, it's generally not very specialized for doing one thing.
    And right now, the only thing we want to do is create a website backend.
That's where Express comes in.
    It allows us to use JavaScript and Node to create our website backend, but it is much better and makes it much quicker and easier.
Looking at an example:
    Using Node to create very simply website, takes about 21 lines of code with just Node.
        The code is complicated, busy and hard to understand.
    Now achieving the exact same end result using Express and Node, we now only need 14 lines of code.
        Not to mention the code is much sparser, leaner and easier to understand.
For backend purposes, using just Node to create a website is borderline pointless.
    In almost all the cases, when we're creating a backend using node, we're going to be using Express becuase of all the advantages we get:
        Readability
        Less code to write
        Add middleware (explained later)
