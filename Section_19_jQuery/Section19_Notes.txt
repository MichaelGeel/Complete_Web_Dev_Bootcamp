# Section 19: jQuery


## 149. What is jQuery:


jQuery is considered the most popular JavaScript library.
There are 1000s of JavaScript libraries out there, and more will be looked at later on.
    But none have been used or downloaded as often as jQuery.
If we look at some of the code from the previous section:
                for (i = 0; i<document.querySelectorAll("button").length; i++) {
                    document.querySelectorAll("button")[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
                        document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "red";
                    });
                }
    This is a lot of JavaScript for a relatively simple task.
jQuery makes it possible to shorten JavaScript code significantly so the above function becomes this:
                $("button").click(function() {
                    $("h1").css("color", "red");
                })
jQuery is a library, which is a bunch of code somebody else wrote that you can incorporate into your own projects and use to improve your own projects or make your life a lot easier.
Bootstrap was also a library.
What jQuery allows you to do is take a line of code:
                document.querySelector("h1");
    This looks through the DOM, selecting the document and querying for the h1.
    And with jQuery, we can instead simply say:
                jQuery("h1");
To be even shorter, the shorthand for "jQuery" is the "$".
                $("h1");
This is visibly shorter, makes our JS code easier to read, easier to debug and faster to debug.
