        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am Michael Geel. Born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa on the 6th May 1998.
            I see myself as a friendly, albeit nervous person who tries his best to get along 
            with others. I am shy initially but become very outgoing and friendly once I open up to others.
