# Section 20: Boss Level Challenge 2 - The Simon Game


## 160. What You'll Make: The Simon Game:


This challenge section is to build a game that is modelled off the game "Simon".
The way the browser game works is:
        You can press any key to start.
        It'll then show you a tile that you have to click on.
        As you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated.
        At some point, you're going to get it wrong.
        When you do, it'll tell you that you got it wrong and you can press any key to restart the game.
