# Section 20: Boss Level Challenge 2 - The Simon Game


## 160. What You'll Make: The Simon Game:


This challenge section is to build a game that is modelled off the game "Simon".
The way the browser game works is:
        You can press any key to start.
        It'll then show you a tile that you have to click on.
