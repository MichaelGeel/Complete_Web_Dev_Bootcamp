The buttons:

Can be pressed any time.
Even if game not started, they run a check and show game over.
This means the user input array and generated array are global variables.

On keypress, game start.
Starts on level 1 (likely a global variable)
Randomly selects a colour and adds to list.
Flashes the square to the user. (This flash is different to the user press flash see below.)
Waits for user to input as many squares as the level (ie same number of square as sequence.)

If wrong:

game over.
(Generated sequence and level reset here).

If right:

User input list reset.
Level goes up.
Another square selected and flashed.
The square is appended to the list (new square added each level increase).
Waits for user input again.

Flash differences:

User flash: toggling pressed class on and off.
Show next in sequence flash: fadeIn - fadeOut toggle.

Note: for the waiting for user input, we remove loops.
So we have individual functions that are called as the game progresses and the individual steps are taken.

Once the game has started, the click event on the document is removed until game over.
