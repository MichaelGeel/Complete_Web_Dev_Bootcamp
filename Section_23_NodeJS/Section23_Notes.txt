# Section 23: Node.js


## 192. What is Node.js?


So we know from the previous section that we can use lots of different languages to write the backend of our web application.
    And similarly, depending on the language we select, we can find a compatible framework to go along with it.
But why do we need and use Frameworks, why can't you just write all the code from scratch using the chosen programming language and create your web server that way.
    It's true, you could write all of your own code from the backend instead of using a framework.
    BUT, because it's such a commonly used functionality, you might as well use the framework.
In that way, a Web-framework provides pre-built components and structures that can be used to build an application without the need for us to write every single line of code from scratch.
But looking at Node.js, it's actually not exactly a framework.
    It's " An asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications."
        This quote according to Node.js itself/themselves.
Breaking down the above quote:
    It's a JavaScript runtime:
        But what is a runtime environment?
            It's important to remember here that when JavaScript was first created, it was designed to run in the browser.
            Meaning it was impossible to use JavaScript to write any kind of program that's not a website,
            But Node uses the V8 engine, which comes from Chromium, is written in C and C++.
                It's incredibly fast and powers the Chrome browser.
            We know that we can write JavaScript code to run in the browser and to provide functionality our websites,
                but in many ways, the JS code that we have is locked in the browser.
            But when Node came along, it free the language out of the browser-lock and allowed us to use it to write any sort of application, desktop or server side.
                Whether it's desktop or server-side.
            And this is in the form of the JavaScript runtime environment.
        Now that Node provides us with this JavaScript runtime so that we can run JavaScript on a machine such the local computer.
            It means we can use JavaScript to accomplish anything that other server-side languages like Ruby, PHP, Python etc can do.
            But also maintaining our full JavaScript stack from frontend to backend.
    It's Asynchronous and Event-driven:
        Asynchronous means that your JavaScript code doesn't have to do everything sequentially.
            Looking back to the scripts that we've written before, our code kind of runs from top to bottom.
                We can have some functions, but essentially everthing is going to happen from beginning to end in a synchronous way.
            Synchronousity effectively means that your computers resources are tied up until some sort of event resolves.
                All the scripts we've previously written thus far have effectively been scynchronous.
        Node is Asynchronous and Event-driven.
            Meaning the resources that would normally be tied up waiting for an event, are instead now freed up to do something else until the event resolves.
            Only then would it run the next blocks of code.
        Effectively, we can parcel up these bits of code into an event so that we know that our code can be triggered when the event happens.
In summary, the reason why we need Node is becuase it allows us to build an application on a computer using JavaScript.
    As we saw earlier, the application is a key aspect of our backend.
This application will be running on our server, and that server, is just a computer, not a browser, and Node.js is what allows this to happen.
Using Node.js also means that both our frontend and backend will comprised of JavaScript (save for the HTML and CSS).
    Meaning we're using JavaScript everywhere inside our web application across the entire stack.
It also means we only need to be familiar with one language and then code can be shared between the client and server side.
Node.js also allows for easy Scaling of applications, making it really good for large-scale professional projects.
    It's fast and non-blocking.
        Because of the asynchronous and event-driven nature of Node, it can be really fast and efficient instead of having to wait for things to happen or blocking the resources.
    It's got a huge ecosystem.
        It's got a really vibrant community and people have contributed thousands of open-source modules and packages to the Node Package Manager, which allows us to easily add functionality to our own applications.
        But it also means there's a lot of resources out there in terms of documentation, tutorials, help, people on StackOverflow to answer questions etc.

## 195. Using Node.js:


With Node successfully installed, let's look at how we can use it to start creating applications.
We can check the version of Node that we're running by typing "node -v" into our terminal.
    Note that we're working with a more recent version of Node here.
Now we need to learn to use the Node REPL.
    Which stands for: "Node Read Eval Print Loop"
    This is not unique to Node.
    The REPL "is a computer environment where user inputs are read and evaluated, and then the results are returned to the user."
        These users inputs we put in are in the form of code, and what we write is read by the computer and evaluated line by line, and then it prints out the result back to us in the command line or in the console.
To initiate the Node REPL, all we have to do is type the command "node".
    Running this command in the terminal, we'll get a "Welcome to Node" greeting, and the symbol before the cursor will change to a ">"
    This symbol tells you that you've successfully entered the node repl.
In the Node REPL, what we're going to do is type commands such as .help
    This gives you some of the other commands that you can use.
    The most important one, because often the hardest thing with REPLs is how to exit them, is the ".exit" command to exit the REPL.
Running ".exit", we'll symbol changes back from the ">" again to whatever other symbol was previously in the terminal.
    Alternatively, you can press "CTRL + C" twice to exit the REPL as well.
CTRL + C is usually the way to get out of anything in the command line.
Now inside the REPL, let's try to do a Read Eval Print Loop.
We'll write a simply "5 + 8" and run it.
    It Read the code, Evaluated the Code, Printed the output, and Looped back to a new line for the next command.
Remember that Node is a JavaScript runtime, so you can write anything that is JavaScript.
    For example: "let a = 3" then "a + 12"
Let's look at how we can write a JavaScript file and use Node to run the entire file.
    Because as useful as a REPL is in the command line, what we actually need to do is to write full code files and to use node as the runtime environment.
So we'll create the file, enter a basic line of code that prints to the terminal and save it.
    Next we want to first navigate to the folder that our file is in, in the terminal.
        Note in VS code we can drag a folder into the terminal to generate the absolute file path for that folder in the terminal.
    Now that we're in the file's directory, we'll type in the "node" command.
        But this time, we'll also type in the name of the file.
        So the command will look like this:
                    "node index.js"
Something a lot of developers do when they are trying to access different files etc is use the tab key to autofill the rest of the file name in the terminal.
    This saves time and also confirms you're in the right directory when trying to run the file.
    Now when we run the above command, we'll see that Node found the file and used the Node runtime to run the code inside index.js.
