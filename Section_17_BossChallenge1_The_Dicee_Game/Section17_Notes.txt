# Section 17: Boss Level Challenge 1 - The Dicee Game:


## 123. Challenge: The Dicee Challenge:


We're creating a Dice Game for this Section as a challenge.
We have a Page, with an h1 saying "Refresh Me".
Then it has 2 h3's saying "Player 1" and "Player 2" and a dice icon underneath each player.
whenever we refresh the website, the dice get thrown randomly, and whoever has the higher dice value wins.
    If even, then it's a draw.
    The h1 text changes in order to output the result.
The next lesson contains the skeleton files for this project in order to focus on the actual JavaScript.
    Alternatively, can build this entire project on own from scratch.


## 124. Dicee Challenge Step 0 - Download the Skeleton Project:


This lesson contains the starting code for the Dicee Game Challenge.
    Opting to not start from scratch for this particular project.
The challenge will first be completed on my own before going any further in this section.


## 125. Dicee Challenge Step 1 - Create an External JavaScript File:


This step just to create the index.js file for the dynamic logic.
Correctly completed prior.


## 126. Dicee Challenge Step 2 - Add Dice Images:


This step was to simply link the 2 img elements directly to a default dice value up front.
This step was correctly completed, img6 linked as default to both img elements.


## 127. Dicee Challenge Step 3 - Create a Random Number:


This step covers the random number generation and multiplying it by 6 and flooring it to simulate a dice roll.
Step completed correctly, was implemented as a function in the js file.


## 128. Dicee Challenge Step 4 - Change the <img> to a Random Dice:


This step covers using the DOM to set the dice img used in the img element to match the dice number generated.
Completed successfully using .setAttribute and string concatenation to reference the correct img.


## 129. Dicee Challenge Step 5 - Change both <img> Elements:


This step is to repeat the steps of lesson 127 and 128 for the second players dice.
Completed successfully, originally done at exact same time as the first players dice.


## 130. Dicee Challenge Step 6 - Change the Title to Display a Winner:


This step was to alter the h1 element to output the result of the dice rolls.
Completed succesfully using querySelector and textContent as well as if statements.


## 131. The Solution to the Dicee Challenge:


This lesson is a solution walkthrough for the Dicee Challenge.
Since the challenge has been completed already, will simply be noting changes and behaviors that are different to my solution.
When adding a JS file, ideal to use an alert that appears on page load to confirm the file is successfully linked.
If not sure about code outputs, be sure to isolate it in order to test the output to understand the behavior.
For independant projects in future, be sure to use string concatenation as done in this project to leverage being able to change images quickly and on the fly.
May be more code, but depending on how often the DOM search is done, remember can save a DOM object to a variable.
Could have used getElementsByClassName as an improvement for getting the img elements in the DOM.
