# Section 17: Boss Level Challenge 1 - The Dicee Game:


## 123. Challenge: The Dicee Challenge:


We're creating a Dice Game for this Section as a challenge.
We have a Page, with an h1 saying "Refresh Me".
Then it has 2 h3's saying "Player 1" and "Player 2" and a dice icon underneath each player.
whenever we refresh the website, the dice get thrown randomly, and whoever has the higher dice value wins.
    If even, then it's a draw.
    The h1 text changes in order to output the result.
The next lesson contains the skeleton files for this project in order to focus on the actual JavaScript.
    Alternatively, can build this entire project on own from scratch.
