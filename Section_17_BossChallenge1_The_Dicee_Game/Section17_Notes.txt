# Section 17: Boss Level Challenge 1 - The Dicee Game:


## 123. Challenge: The Dicee Challenge:


We're creating a Dice Game for this Section as a challenge.
We have a Page, with an h1 saying "Refresh Me".
Then it has 2 h3's saying "Player 1" and "Player 2" and a dice icon underneath each player.
whenever we refresh the website, the dice get thrown randomly, and whoever has the higher dice value wins.
    If even, then it's a draw.
    The h1 text changes in order to output the result.
The next lesson contains the skeleton files for this project in order to focus on the actual JavaScript.
    Alternatively, can build this entire project on own from scratch.


## 124. Dicee Challenge Step 0 - Download the Skeleton Project:


This lesson contains the starting code for the Dicee Game Challenge.
    Opting to not start from scratch for this particular project.
The challenge will first be completed on my own before going any further in this section.

This step just to create the index.js file for the dynamic logic.

This step was correctly completed, img6 linked as default to both img elements.


## 127. Dicee Challenge Step 3 - Create a Random Number:


This step covers the random number generation and multiplying it by 6 and flooring it to simulate a dice roll.
Step completed correctly, was implemented as a function in the js file.


## 128. Dicee Challenge Step 4 - Change the <img> to a Random Dice:


This step covers using the DOM to set the dice img used in the img element to match the dice number generated.
Completed successfully using .setAttribute and string concatenation to reference the correct img.


## 129. Dicee Challenge Step 5 - Change both <img> Elements:


This step is to repeat the steps of lesson 127 and 128 for the second players dice.
