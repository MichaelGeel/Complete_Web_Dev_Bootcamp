    In here, there's already a class called "gradient-background", and this code comes from a codepen by Manuel Pinto, where he created a pure CSS gradient background.
    We're simply using this code but defining some unique colours of our own.
    Similar to what's been getting done with Bootstrap, simply need to add this class to HTML elements to get the gradient to show.
Notes from doing this exercise:
    SVG's behave differently when put directly into the HTML vs linked via an image element.
    CDT is your friend, use him.
Notes after completing the exercise and looking at the completion video:
    An easy way to identify extra padding vs margin is the background of the extended area.
        If the background is extended, it's padding.
        If it's whitespace, it's margin.
    Always check that there is no margin, if an element inside a div has a margin causing whitespace, it may not 
        show up when hoverin over the div, so always drill down to check the inner components.
    Remember that most sizing and spacing manipulation can be handled using classes in Bootstrap
    The testimonial section comes from the Jumbotron section in the Bootstrap website.
    Remember a container always needs a row div in it.
        Then in the row goes the column items.
    Note can also have multiple rows within a column.
    With Bootstrap, sometimes the element you're using can be changed without affecting the result too much.
        For example changing an h1 to h2.
        This is because the design is based on the class rather than the element itself.
