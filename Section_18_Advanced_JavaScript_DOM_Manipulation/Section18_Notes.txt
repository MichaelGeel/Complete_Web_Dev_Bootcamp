## 134. What We'll Make: Drum Kit:


In order to learn about some of the more intermediate/advanced parts of the Document Object Model, we'll be building a DrumKit website.
By the end of this module, we'll learn how to add event listeners to buttons and keystrokes to know when a user is typing on their keyboard or

The website basically is a number of buttons that are linked to various drum sounds that can either be clicked or are also linked to certain keyboard key presses.
