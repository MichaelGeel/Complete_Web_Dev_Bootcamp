# Section 16: The Document Object Model (DOM)

## 114. Adding JavaScript to Websites:


Up until now, we've been learning about JavaScript and using it inside the CDT console.
This is the purest form of JavaScript, seeing the code as it is and seeing what it does.
    But it's no use learning about it if we're not going to apply it to our website.
This lesson will now look at how we can incorporate JavaScript into our websites.
For starters, we'll create a new folder and name it "DOM".
    "DOM" stands for Document Object Model.
    This will be covered in the coming lessons.
We'll add in the html boilerplate, link it to a stylesheet that we'll create as well.
    Both inside the DOM folder.
Inside the HTML we'll add a heading.
So what if we now wanted to insert some JavaScript?
    Let's look at trying to get our website to load up a Javascript alert.
Previously, we saw that there were 3 ways to inject CSS into our HTML document.
    JavaScript works similarly to this.
    We can add inline JavaScript by simply adding an attribute into the HTML tag.
        For example, we can give our body the "onload" attribute.
                <body onload="">
        This attribute means that when the body of our HTML gets loaded up, whatever JavaScript we place in those quotation marks will be carried out.
When trying to add the JavaScript code for the alert, we come into a problem though.
    Namely that the JavaScript needs to be enclosed in quotation marks, but in our alert, we also require quotation marks around the string "Hello".
    To solve this, we need to keep one set of quotation marks as doubles "", and the next set inside of the doubles as singles ''.
Now when the body is loaded up, it'll look inside the quotation marks for the JavaScript code that needs to be carried out.
    Note that this is only effective in the browser, the popup/Javascript won't activate using the preview extension in VS Code.
Now inline JS has a lot of the same downsides as inline CSS.
    Not very modular, difficult to debug and not good practice.
The next way of incorporating JS is using internal JS.
    This we can add by using a <script></script> tag, and everything between the opening and closing tags can be plain JavaScript code.
    Note in the opening script tag, we need to include what is being written inside the script, so we add the attribute and value:
        <script type="text/JavaScript">
    When the page is loaded up, the browser will read through the website code line by line and once it hits the script tag, it'll carry out the JavaScript that's inside.
Finally, we can also incorporate Javascript as an external file.
    Instead of having a simple script tag like with internal, we now add the src attribute to the script tag as well, the value of the src attribute being the location of our Javascript file.
    Then inside the JavaScript file we can add our Javascript code that'll then be run by the browser.
Now inside the HTML document, WHERE we place the script tags matters GREATLY.
    With CSS, we put the link in the head element so that it gets loaded up first before any of the content of the website (inside the body).
        Now if we were to place the CSS at the end of the body, then the CSS styling the HTML document would only be applied AFTER all of the content of the HTML document has been created in the browser.
        Meaning you'll first see the HTML with it's default settings and layout, then only later on would the CSS be applied.
    But with JavaScript, it's the opposite.
        This is because, inside our JavaScript, if we try to change an HTML element that does not yet exist, then it'll error out and fail.
To demonstrate the above, we'll write the following line into our JavaScript file:
        document.querySelector("h1").innerHTML = "Good Bye";
        This simply changes the text of the h1 element from "Hello" to "Good Bye".
    Now if we run the website again, when the page loads up, we first see the h1 element saying hello, then if we dismiss the alert, it changes to goodbye.
But if we placed the script tag in the head of the HTML file:
    We'd get the popup, then the h1 would only show "Hello".
    If we open the CDT and check the console, we see it's throwing an Uncaught TypeError.
        It gives this error because we're trying to access a property of a Null (because the h1 doesn't exist yet).
This is why we always place the script tag at the bottom of the HTML body element.
The added benefit of this is that if you have a lot of JavaScript code, which is usually a bit more time-consuming to run, then at least all of the content of the website will have been loaded up for the user to see.
    The code will then run while the user is looking at the content of the website, and in this way it makes it look as if your website is loading faster.


## 115. Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM):


Up until this point, our websites have been static.
    We've planned what content our website should have and also the appearance of that content.
    This in the form of the HTML and CSS.
Now if we wanted our website to be interactive, then we need to be able to change parts of our website on the fly.
    So if a user had to click on the a button, we'll need to respond to that by changing the content or appearance of our website.
But once our website is live on the Internet, we can't sit there and wait for the user to click on things and update and reload the webpage.
    This problem is what the Document Object Model (DOM) solves.
The DOM basically catalogs the web page into individual objects that we can select and manipulate.
Let's say we have a really basic website with a head, body, title and button.
The task of converting an HTML file into the DOM is done by the browser when you load up the web page.
    What it does, is it turns each of the elements and their associated data into a tree structure with a whole bunch of objects that you can select and manipulate.
    The relationships between the objects are mapped out in the tree diagram.
For example, using the above described HTML file:
    The head and body sections are siblings, the title is a child/direct descendant of the head and similarly the button to the body.
    Everything is contained inside your HTML document, is contained in an object called "The Document".
So let's look at the DOM in action.
    We have an HTML template (provided in the course resources).
    And empty styles.css and index.js files.
We can install an HTML Tree Visualizer as a Chrome plugin (free) which takes the HTML of a page, and turns it into a tree diagram to view what the browser does when it makes this change.
Now we can actually tap into the DOM using JavaScript and navigate through the tree.
    So we'll open this HTML file in the browser and open the CDT.
We can see what the document looks like by printing it in the console by calling:
        document;
    If you expand what the console outputs, you see it has returned the entire HTML file that we've got open in the browser.
Now if we wanted to navigate through this document object, we can go to the first element child:
        document.firstElementChild;
    This returns everything that's inside the HTML element.
We can go a step further by looking for the first child of the first child of the document object:
        document.firstElementChild.firstElementChild;
    This returns everything inside the Head HTML element/object.
If, instead of the head we wanted the body, we could use lastElementChild:
        document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild;
    This returns the body and everything inside of it.
If you wanted to select the h1, which is the first element child of the body, you'd just add another layer.
Once you've successfully selected the object you're interested in inside the DOM, then you can manipulate it.
    We could start this by saving a particular object inside a variable.
            var heading = document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.firstElementChild;
    Then if we entered "heading" into the console, we'd see it points to the h1 of our webpage.
Then if we wanted to manipulate that h1 one, for example change the text, we could simply say:
        heading.innerHTML = "Good Bye";
    If we run this in the console, it then gets run and the web page in the browser changes to reflect this change in the h1.
There are many different ways to manipulate the objects.
    For example, we could change the colour of the h1 heading using:
        heading.style.color = "red";
We can also select elements and make them do things.
    For example, we can select the input checkbox using:
        document.querySelector("input").click();
            The querySelector looks inside our entire document for the object that has the selector of "input"
            Once we have that object, we'll call the .click() method on it, which simulates a mouse click.
So we can see that our objects inside the DOM can have properties and methods.
    Properties describe something about the object.
    Methods are things that the object can do.
Taking this and using a car as an example, a car also has properties and methods.
    The car would have Properties like its Colour, Number of Seats, Number of Doors
    And it would have Methods like brake, drive, park.
So we can use JavaScript to manipulate our objects, and it's all done using the dot notation.
    If our car was an object, we'd use the dot notation to get its colour like this:
        car.colour;
    And this would return the colour of the car.
The above example (car.color;) is a Getter, because it gives us the current value of the car's colour property.
With properties, we can also set it, for example we could say:
            car.numberOfDoors = 0;
    Which would set the numberOfDoors property to 0.
    This is called Setting a property.
For Methods, we also use the dot notation, but note that methods are like functions and require a set of brackets after them.
    For example, if we were to call a drive method on the car:
            car.drive();
    This would in turn make the car start driving.
    This is referred to as "Calling" a method on our object.
The only difference between a method and a function, is that:
    A Method is something that an object can do, so it has to be associated with an object.
Now going back into the DOM of the HTML file we're working with.
    If we were to select the button, then we're able to tap into some of its properties to get it and set it as well as use some of its methods to get it to do things.
    The Properties of the button would be things like:
        .innerHTML
        .style
        .firstElementChild
    The Methods (which include the brackets) would be things like:
        .click()
        .appendChild()
        .setAttribute()
The presence of the brackets is the big teller on the difference between the Properties and Methods of an object.
Lesson Challenge:
    Select the third li element and change the text of to whatever you want using JavaScript in the console.
    The solution will be detailed in the next lesson.


## 116. Solution to the DOM Challenge:


Course solution to the Challenge at the end of lesson 115:
document.firstElementChild.lastElementChild.querySelector("ul").lastElementChild.innerHTML = "Bob";


## 117. Selecting HTML Elements with JavaScript:


In the previous lesson we saw we could use the querySelector() method to select HTML elements.
    But there are many other ways of selecting HTML elements.
For this lesson, we're copying over the same files as in 115, except we've added in some IDs and Classes to try out alternative ways of selecting elements.
The first one we'll look at is:
            document.getElementsByTagName("li")
    This method looks through the web page for an element with a particular tag name.
    So we can search for a particular element by the tag of that element, such as "li", or "h1" etc.
        If we search this document for the "li" tagname, we'll get an array containing all 3 of our list items.
        If we expand the array and then expand one of those list items, we can see a whole collection of properties that can be manipulated.
    It's important to note that this method differs from querySelector in that it fetches ALL elements on the web page with a particular tag name.
        That's why the method name is getElementS (plural on elements)
    This is important because when you try to manipulate one of the elements selected by this method, if we use the previous method to change the color for example:
            document.getElementsByTagName("li").style.color = "purple";
        This'll throw an error because we're trying to set the color purple to an array, not the list items.
        So instead we'd have to select the item in the array that we want to change.
            document.getElementsByTagName("li")[2].style.color = "purple";
    In addition to being able to tap into a particular element inside the array of items returned, we can also work with the array like any other normal array.
        We could find out how many "li" elements there are using the .length; property of the array.
The next method for getting elements is:
            document.getElementsByClassName("classname");
    This allows you to select elements based on the name of a class.
        Once again, this method will also return all elements in the form of an array with a particular class name.
    Even if one or no elements are found, it'll still return them in the form of an array.
The last of the methods in the "getElementsBy..." lot is:
            document.getElementById("title");
    Note that this one is singular, as an ID for an element should be unique, so it'll only ever be a single element.
    This only returns the element object, no array format or anything.
        So we can directly assign property values or call methods on the object selected in this manner (no indexing required).
We could also use the querySelector method we've already seen to select a single element.
    This method only returns a single item, but it works differently.
    This string we put inside the brackets for this method is a CSS Selector.
    But whatever selector you put inside the brackets for this selector, it'll only return the first element that matches the selector criteria.
        For example, in a series of li elements inside the ul, only the first li will be returned.
    However, we're also able to combine selectors in this method to increase our selector specificity.
    You can use this for any valid CSS selector, but you'll only get the first element for whatever selector.
Now if you wanted to get all elements that match the criteria of your querySelector, then you'd have to use:
            document.querySelectorAll("li.item");
    This again returns an array containing all elements in the HTML document that satisfies the selector.
        Once again, if we wanted to manipulate one of the elements, we'd have to select a specific one using an index.
Now given all these different selector methods, which one should we use?
    So querySelector and querySelectorAll allow for more complex queries, give us more direct element selection.
        This is more precise so these methods are the most commonly used for query selection.
    The other methods are more broad and not as commonly used/useful.
Lesson challenge:
    We need to change the text colour of the Google link in the list element to red.
    See my solution in the index.js file for this lesson.
Made use of querySelector to only get the singular item we're looking for to directly be able to manipulate it.


## 118. Manipulating and Changing Styles of HTML Elements with JavaScript:


Copied over the same files from the previous lesson once again.
Having seen how to target elements using the DOM, let's look at how to use JavaScript to manipulate the elements that we've selected.
As we've seen previously, we can change the CSS style dynamically using JavaScript by tapping into the style property of an element object.
For example, if we wanted to change the text color of the h1 element:
            document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "red";
Every single CSS property can be changed in this way using JavaScript, but the property names may look different.
We noted earlier that JavaScript names tend to be camelCased.
    For example: querySelector.
    This is standard for naming methods and properties in JavaScript.
But because of this, when trying to change CSS styles, the property names don't look exactly the same as they would in CSS.
    For example:
        In CSS: font-size is the property.
        In JavaScript: fontSize is the property.
The names for these properties in JavaScript can be found in W3schools under the DOM style object documentation.
    As a rule of thumb, they're exactly the same, unless the property would break camelCasing convention in JavaScript.
We also need to note that whatever value you're setting a property to in JavaScript has to be represented as a string.
    For example:
        In CSS: padding: 7%
        In JS: padding = "7%";
    Even what is normally a number in CSS has to be represented inside a string in JavaScript.
Lesson Challenge:
    Using only JavaScript, change the background color of the button to yellow.
    See solution in the lesson's index.js file
Simply using the backgroundColor property in JavaScript (as the name is slightly different to CSS).


## 119. The Separation of Concerns: Structure vs Style vs Behavior:


For this lesson, we've once again copied over the same 3 files as with the previous lessons and reference them further in the lesson.
When we're writing code for websites, in order to keep our code tidy and easy to debug, we have to keep in mind the idea of the separation of concerns at all times.
What this means is that:
    Your HTML is for content only.
    You CSS is for styling your website.
    Your JavaScript is there for the behavior of your website.
Thus far we haven't exactly followed this rule while we've been learning JavaScript.
    For example, changing the color of the h1 element using JavaScript isn't good practice and doesn't follow this rule.
    Ideally, these kinds of styles should be inside of our CSS.
The problem is that if we wanted our styling to change dynamcially, then we'd need to make those changes using JavaScript.
    For example, if a user clicks on a button and the colour of the background changes.
But there is another way to solve the above issue, other than simply using the style property.
    We can tap into something called a "classList", which is a property of every DOM object.
    For example, if we ran a get on the classList property of the button on our page:
            document.querySelector("button").classList;
    We'll see that we get an array of classes that are attached to this element that we found.
        In this case, we did it on the button and we can also see it only has a single class of "btn".
Once we have the list of classes, then we can use methods, such as .add, and we can add classes to the class list.
            document.querySelector("button").classList.add("invisible");
    If we run this code and fetch the array of classes for the button again, we'll see it now has 2 classes instead of one.
What we can now do is go to the stylesheet and create a separate class with styling for an element.
    Then when we add that class to the element, it'll add all the styling for the class to the element, which saves on us needing to add all the styling individually.
This allows us to keep all our styling inside the CSS stylesheet, but turn it on and off using JavaScript by manipulating the classes applied to the elements.
In addition to add, we can also remove classes from an element's classlist.
            document.querySelector("button").classList.remove("invisible");
    This removes the class from the button element in the DOM.
    Upon removing the class, all styles that are a part of that class in the CSS also no longer apply to the element.
The last method that's useful is "toggle".
            document.querySelector("button").classList.toggle("invisible");
    Basically what toggle does is:
        If the class is applied, then remove it, else if the class is removed, apply it.
    It's a shorthand for applying both add and remove to a single action without any state-checking.
    Note that toggle also returns either true or false.
        It returns true if it added the class to the element.
        It returns false if it removed the class from the element.
Using this class manipulation on the elements, we're adhering to the rule of Separation of Concerns.
    This means, when we need to debug our code, it's much easier, because if an element doesn't look how we want it to, then we can simply dig into the stylesheet and change it.
    But if it's not behaving the way we want it to, then we can go into the JavaScript and dig into the code there.
Lesson Challenge:
    Create a class in the stylesheet called "huge" which sets font-size to 10rem.
    Any element this class is applied to has it's font-size changed to 10rem.
    Then apply it to the h1.
Note that when adding a class to an element in JavaScript, we don't include the "." before it like we would in CSS.
    We type the class, enclosed in a string, as we would in HTML.


## 120. Text Manipulation and the Text Content Property:
