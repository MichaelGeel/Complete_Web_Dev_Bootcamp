# Section 21: The Unix Command Line:


## 185. Install Git Bash on Windows:


Note Macs come with Git Back pre-installed.
This course has a link to download Git SCM for windows.
Then run the installer.
    Ensure Git Bash Here is checked in the installer.
Leave the folder as Git and leave everything else as default all the way until you can install Git.
Then to check that it works, open up a new terminal in VS Code.
In the new terminal, click the dropdown button, next to "powershell" in the top right corner of the terminal.
    This should have our cursor on a newline next to a $ symbol in the terminal.
To configure VS Code to make Git Bash the defualt shell, we need to go to the command palette.
    Can be found at View -> Command Palette
    Then we'll search for "Terminal: Select Default Profile"
    After selecting that, we select Git Bash.
Now every time a new terminal is openeing, we're working with Git Bash.
And now Git Bash has been set up.


## 186. Understanding the Command Line. Long Live the Command Line!
