## 99. Random Number Generation in JavaScript: Building a Love Calculator:


This section is going to be looking at some more advanced features in JavaScript, such as randomization and control flow.
JavaScript has a way of generating random numbers using the Math.random() function.
    It generates a 16 decimal place number between 0 and 0.9999...(16 9s).
    For example: 0.7032882360745665
The function never reaches 1.
This is useful as it allows us to generate up to a billion random numbers.
Note that a function always requires a set of brackets to be run, even if no input is required.
Now if we wanted to use this function to simulate a dice roll, for example:
    We could first multiply it by 6.
    Then we can use Math.floor() on the number to turn it into a whole number to return to the user.
Note that with math.Floor(), you need to add 1 to the result as the number range from 0 to 5 instead of 1 to 6.
    Adding 1 to the result would fix the output range.
The Math.random() function is called a "pseudo-random number generator".
    It's called this because a computer is essentially a bunch of switches, and depending on whether a switch is on or off, you get 1s or 0s.
    And through these switches the computer does all its computing.
    But there's one thing it's not very good at, which is being random.
Becuase a computer is an entirely deterministic process, it's not very easy to get a true random number.
    So instead, people have created mathematical formulas designed to simulate this process instead.
So we've mentioned how the Math.random() function returns a value between 0 and 0.9xe-16, but that return is not very useful to us until we scale it.
    This is easily done by multiplying it by the max value of the range we want.
    Then naturally manupulate the decimals to fit your needs and modify by the minimum value of the range (adding it.)
The above process is a simple way to achieve any number range desired (provided the range is less than a billion values).
    Granted you could raise the random number to itself to increase the possible output range.
Lesson Challenge:
    Get 2 prompts from the user for 2 names.
    Then ignore the names and generate a random number between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
    Return it to the user using an alert.
See solution code in the associate notes file.
Note that with the random function, if your range is from 0 - x, then multiply it by x+1 as the random numbers won't include the x+1 value.
